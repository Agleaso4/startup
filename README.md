# startup
This is the first change that I am making from GitHub
This is the second commit from my VSCode 

The thing that I learned during this assignment was the ease of being able to figure things out with multiple people working
on one project in multiple locations, to help be more proficient. I also learned that it is easier to always do a git pull 
before working on it so you are up to date.

Elevator Pitch - 
Landscaping is one of the few occupations that is still a little behind the technology curve, and our goal at Green connect is to merge this gap. With our technology, we connect landscapers to their customers with one website. There are different sides to this website, one being the customer side where they can select different greenery that they want present in their yard and they can upload scetches or arial photos of their yard, so they can space everything out perfectly to their heart's desire. They can upload the design through the connected portal with all the specific plants that are wanted. On the Landscaper's side, they can access the customer's drawing's and greenery list by clicking on the customer's profile. This will also have a calendar on both the customer's and landscaper's sides to help coordinate and notify about installation and follow up visits.

Picture of a beautiful landscaped yard 

Client's page - 
A calendar page of when landscaping visits are scheduled
A project upload page where they can upload photos of drawn out plans or arial photos that have been marked up and a list of greenery that is wanted by the customer

Landscaper's page - 
A calendar page with all of the visits that are scheduled
A customer list where they can check out the specific wants of each customer via the uploaded photos and the list of greenery.

AWS - EC2-
I created an instance and assigned an elastic IP to it which is http://3.132.194.124/
SSH'd into my instance >ssh -i "june10.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-132-194-124.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
OR
ssh -i "june10.pem" ubuntu@greenconnect.click

The new link is https://greenconnect.click/ 
We created a secure connection via the caddy server that talks with "Let's Encrypt" which allows for privacy and security to go along with the app.

Introduction to html, I made a fork and customized the wording and the link to greenconnect.click so that was a cool opportunity. The other thing that I learned was how to section the wording off with certain commands. https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/poZqLBM

HTML Structure, I built and created some more tables where the calendar could go, and it helped me see what I could start doing for my future website to make it simple for the programmer and the user. https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/RwBEJzG

HTML Input, I customized a few things to go along with a very rough draft of what I am wanting to do with my website which is awsome. My URL https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/MWBZBQM
Original with all the inputs https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/dyVdNej

HTML Media, super excited about the logo that I was able to make. https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/ExpMPKP 

I was able to continue to setup my startup, and the formatting that I want it to have.
I have made different pages for different types of users, and they are connected correctly.
I made sure that they all look uniform with one another.

CSS Practice https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/yLxBjKz I was able to apply the centering technique and different button styles to make the index page look better, and I also learned how to implement it via another file rather than inline css

CSS Simon - 
I was able to notice a lot of good techniques that I will be transfering over to my startup platform like the simplicity factor. I feel like my startup is cool, but it does jump and it is a little comple. I also liked the emphasis on classes, and I am going to integrate that more especially to classify the users and the landscapers controls. 

I was able to learn how to add certain colorings with different placements, which I am excited about, and it looks so much better. 

I also was able to add in the google calendar from each, thing, and I will be setting up the accounts for the users and the landscapers, so they sync automatically

JavaScript Functions https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/bGxeWMZ?editors=1111 I was able to write functions in JavaScript, and the thing that I thought was the most interesting was the inner functions and the anonymous functions.

JavaScript Arrow Functions - https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/ZEMOoNZ?editors=0011 I really liked learning of all the ways I could define these arrow functions, and how I could pass multiple variables in with the parentheses.

JavaScript Arrays https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/oNPLMLy?editors=1111 The main things that I took away from this, are the versatility of array in JavaScript, and how we can manipulate them with single commands, as we combine arrow functions as well. 

JavaScript Objects and Classes https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/WNgGXgr?editors=0012 I think it is cool so we can classify things in classes, so we can sort them out with the startup. I think it is also nice with the objects, being able to store those values with paired names

JavaScript Destructuring - https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/oNPYMpp?editors=1111 I was able to figure out how to take specific things out of arrays and objects, and also add to them

JavaScript Exceptions https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/WNgomQP?editors=0011 The Try Catch and Finally are super useful, and I like how on the finally, it always prints out what you have allocated for that so it runs even when try or catch are called.

JavaScript Rest and Spread https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/dyqOLGg?editors=0011 The rest is where we can pass in an undefined number of parameter and the spread allows us to seperate the parameters with the select number we have allocated.

JavaScript Regular Expressions https ://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/mdGOYPE?editors=0011 We were able to learn how the control f is used and how it works on a very basic level, and we will be able to use it in our future applications. 

JavaScript Document Object Model https://codepen.io/agleaso4/pen/eYLgENv I learned a little bit about implementing JavaScript and how it can act as HTML and create tables. I want to figure out how to pass in information. 

Finished the JavaScript for the simon startup application. I tested it and everything is working the way it was supposed to. I need to really understand the little things about JavaScript, but being able to look things up, I was able to understand mostly everything that was pushed through.

Finished the JavaScript for this startup application, and I was able to figure out how to transfer data between input on one HTML doc to another table in another HTML doc. I also added some calendars to show the day that they are on so they can add appointment so they don't have to look at their phone to see the dates or switch apps to see the dates. I also added the functionality to click the logo and have it take you back to the home page so it is easier to navigate. 

I completed the service  for the Simon startup application, and the things that I want to remember are the frameworks we can use for services. I also think know the difference on how to upload is also a big part, otherwise they won't register correctly and they won't work.
