# startup
This is the first change that I am making from GitHub
This is the second commit from my VSCode 

The thing that I learned during this assignment was the ease of being able to figure things out with multiple people working
on one project in multiple locations, to help be more proficient. I also learned that it is easier to always do a git pull 
before working on it so you are up to date.
