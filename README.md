This is the first change that I am making from GitHub
This is the second commit from my VSCode 

The thing that I learned during this assignment was the ease of being able to figure things out with multiple people working
on one project in multiple locations, to help be more proficient. I also learned that it is easier to always do a git pull 
before working on it so you are up to date.

Elevator Pitch - 
Landscaping is one of the few occupations that is still a little behind the of technology, and our goal at Green connect is to merge this gap. With our technology, we connect landscapers to their customers with one website. There are different sides to this website, one being the customer side where they can select different greenery that they want present in their yard and they can upload scetches or arial photos of their yard, so they can space everything out perfectly to their heart's desire. They can upload the design through the connected portal with all the specific plants that are wanted. On the Landscaper's side, they can access the customer's drawing's and greenery list by clicking on the customer's profile. This will also have a calendar on both the customer's and landscaper's sides to help coordinate and notify about installation and follow up visits.
